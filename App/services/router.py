"""
Router -- The Traffic Cop for the RAG pipeline.

Classifies every incoming question into one of three intents:
  ? LOOKUP  -> semantic search in Qdrant (regulations, policies, concepts)
  ? COMPUTE -> SQL query against SQLite (student data, marks, attendance, faculty)
  ? HYBRID  -> SQL first, then RAG merge (e.g. find top student + describe their record)

Decision flow (in priority order):
  1. COMPUTE fast-patterns  -- bare reg numbers, search-by-name, subject/marks queries
  2. HYBRID  patterns       -- two-part: "compute X AND describe Y"
  3. Keyword scoring        -- count COMPUTE vs LOOKUP keyword hits
  4. LLM fallback           -- for truly ambiguous questions

Key rule: ALL student/faculty record lookups (by name, reg no, department) must
           route to COMPUTE (SQL), NOT Qdrant RAG. Qdrant only holds documents
           like policies, syllabi, regulations -- not tabular student records.
